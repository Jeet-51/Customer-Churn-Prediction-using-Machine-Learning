# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we used the customer churn dataset from a bank to construct a predictive model for the likely churn clients. The variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal). Therefore this is a classification project. The goal here is to model the probability of churn, the customers of the bank are identified as churn or loyal based on the potential features like credit score, age, gender, estimated salary, etc. A user of the bank is classified as loyal if he/she is active and remains with the bank. Customers are classified as churners if they switch to another bank.

We built a deep learning model to predict the churn and use accuracy,precision and f1-score to measure performance of our modelIn this project, we used the customer churn dataset from a bank to construct a predictive model for the likely churn clients.
